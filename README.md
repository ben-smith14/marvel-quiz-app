# marvel-quiz-app
This is an Android app that quizzes the user on the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

NOTE: More recent updates have allowed the app to work correctly when transitioning between portrait and landscape mode and vice versa. This is not reflected in the images below however, as they were taken from the initial version.
